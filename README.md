# Text Editor CLI Application - DSA Assignment

Welcome to the repository for the C program I developed for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignment during my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. This CLI application implements various text editor functionalities, including UNDO and REDO features. The program was rigorously tested against specific time and memory constraints and achieved the maximum grade. Inside, you'll find the source code showcasing efficient use of data structures and algorithms to deliver a responsive and functional text editing tool.
